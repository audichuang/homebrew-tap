  caveats <<~EOS
    Orca Fork shares its bundle id and settings with the official Orca, so run only one at a time.
    Its built-in auto-update is off; update with:
      brew upgrade --cask orca-fork
    It is not notarized (ad-hoc signed only). If macOS refuses to open it:
      xattr -cr "#{appdir}/Orca Fork.app"
