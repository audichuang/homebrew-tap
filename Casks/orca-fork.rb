  # No zap: the profile under ~/Library/Application Support/Orca and ~/.orca is shared with the official app.

  caveats <<~EOS
    Orca Fork shares its bundle id and settings with the official Orca, so run only one at a time.
    Its built-in auto-update is off; update with:
      brew upgrade --cask orca-fork
